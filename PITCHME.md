# We need more documentation

* ...that's will answer most user inquiries.

# We need a common language
* What's a mediation layer, a translation layer, transportation layer...?
* How do you define REST endpoints?
* Is it OpenAPI v3, OpenAPI v2, or Swagger?
+++
# We need a way to more quickly diagnose failures complicated requests?
* How do I trace a specific request?
