# What was it?
+++?image=assets/images/workshops-text.jpg&size=contain
+++?image=assets/images/presentations-text.jpg&size=contain
+++
# Size 
...small...

( between 200 and 300 people )
+++
# Community
* Microsoft Developers
* Google Developers
* Smart Bear Developers
* and Various Community Developers
---
# Where was it?
+++?image=assets/images/portland.png
+++
Portland "do"s...
* eat Voodoo Doughnuts.
* hike Forest Park.
* visit Powell's and the Saturday Market.
+++
Portland "don't"s...
* ignore the east side.
* rent a car.
* tip the homeless.
---
# Why did I propose it?
+++
### We need more documentation
* ...that's consistent.
* ...that accounts for various versions across environments.
* ...that's will answer most user inquiries.
+++
### We need a common language
* What's a mediation layer, a translation layer, a transportation layer...?
* How do you define REST endpoints?
* Is it OpenAPI v3, OpenAPI v2, or Swagger?
+++
### We need a way to more quickly diagnose failures?
* How do I trace a specific request?
* How can we analyze requests without needing to change the legacy infrastructure?
* Is it a software or hardware problem?
+++
### etc...
* We should automate more.
* We should standardize to industry security.
* ...and so much more...
+++
### I needed to see how the industry approached these and other API pain points.
---
# How could we be documenting our APIs?
+++ 
We're already using swagger (OAS v2.0)

But were you aware of:
* Swagger CodeGen?
* Swagger Editor?
* Redoc?
* Zally?
---
# How could we be implementing our APIs?
+++
Leveraging openshift continues to become easier and easier:
* service mesh
* distributed tracing
* circuit breaker methodology
---
# How could we be using our APIs?
+++

---
# The Verdict?
+++
* Portland is great!
* The workshops will payoff once istio is past alpha!
* Plenty of tooling to strengthen our weakness.
* I would go again, hopefully as a mentor rather than a mentee.
